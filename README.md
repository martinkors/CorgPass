# CorgPass

*The project is unfinished due to the chip shortage.*

A board that was meant to be used as a physical password storage device. The board was supposed to have an OLED display and a fingerprint sensor. Then you would have a program on your computer to interact with the device, where you would choose which password you would like to input, choosing from a list of names that you have given to the passwords. When you have requested a password, you would go to the field that you would like to insert your password into and scan your finger, then the USB would send keystrokes to the computer, inputting the saved password. Adding passwords to the device and setting up the fingerprints would be done through the program and then be sent to the USB.
